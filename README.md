 Merry Beesmas everyone! I love Bee Swarm Simulator, but it has a lot of timers that the player has to keep track of, especially with all of the new Beesmas dispensers, planters, and Puffshrooms. I made this program, which I call **BusyBee** to have a place for all of the BSS timers in one place! In its current version, it is pretty simple, and just has the basic dispensers, Memory Match, Mobs, etc, but I plan to add Planter timers, push notifications for select timers, the ability to only show certain timers, and more in the future! Check the *TODO.txt* file for all of the changes I am planning.

 A couple things to know about BusyBee are:
 
**1:** It stores the datetime your timers will end in a file; therefore, if you close the program, it will still keep track of your timers

**2:** BusyBee assumes you have a Gifted Vicious Bee by default (which means that your Mob and Boss cooldowns are reduced by 15%). If you don't have Gifted Vicious, you can set the value to false in *local/settings.json*. You will need to have run the program at least once for this file to appear.

**3:** This is the first version! It is under active development and I plan to add a plethora of features - if I stay motivated - so be sure to check back for new stuff, and feel free to send recommendations/report issues.

 Hope BusyBee helps you guys :)
